\section{Conclusion}
The history and characteristics of power systems, especially synchronous generators, were discussed. The modeling, design, and testing phase were presented and documented. The proposed design proved to be superior to the other solutions presented as part of the in-class competition. The authors gained substantial knowledge about real-world compensator design used in power systems around the world.
