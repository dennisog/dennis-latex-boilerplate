\section{Backround}
The invention of generators was made possible by Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 \cite{faraday}. Faraday was able to demonstrate his discovery with a simple generator, however, there was little need for the production of electricity at that point in time. Nikola Tesla invented the first polyphase AC generator which superimposed several different AC flows into a single polyphase output. With a practical AC generator in hand, along with transformers to raise and lower voltage, Tesla's system could be used to implement large distribution networks. These larger systems, such as the Niagara Falls hydroelectric plant built in the 1890s, lower costs and paved the way for power systems as we know them today \cite{generators}.
